1. Introduction
=========================================================================
Trie is a data structure of ordered tree that implements an associative array.
Looking up a record key (usually a string) is very efficient, which takes O(1)
with respect to the number of stored records n. Trie is also known for efficient
prefix matching, where the retrieved key strings are the prefixes of a given
query string.

Double-array trie, which was proposed by Jun-ichi Aoe in the late 1980s,
represents a trie in two parallel arrays (BASE and CHECK). Reducing the storage
usage drastically, double array tries have been used in practical applications
such as morphological analysis, spelling correction, and Japanese Kana-Kanji
convertion.

Static Double Array Trie (DASTrie) is an implementation of static double-array
trie. For the simplicity and efficiency, DASTrie focuses on building a static
double array from a list of records sorted by dictionary order of keys. DASTrie
does not provide the functionality for updating an existing trie, whereas the
original framework of double array supports dynamic updates.
